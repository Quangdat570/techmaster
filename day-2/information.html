    <p class="list-text">Rated the best wooden cutting board by our experts, the Teakhaus cutting board is, no surprise, made from teak wood (a high-oil wood that fights off moisture) which creates an ideal surface for all kinds of cutting, mincing, and chopping. Plus, its beautiful grain makes it a perfect addition to any kitchen decor.</p>
    <p class="list-text">The consumer price index increased 8.6% annually, the largest rise since December 1981, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists had predicted inflation would hold steady at 8.3%.</p>
    <p class="list-text">After inflation eased off its recent four-decade high in April, economists thought it had begun a grindingly slow descent. Mays return to historic levels reveals just how intractable inflation has become as a broad range of goods and services rose sharply.</p>

    <p class="text-endding">The report bolsters the Federal Reserve's plans to raise its key interest rate by half a percentage point at both its meeting next week and its gathering in July as part of an aggressive bid to curb inflation. The campaign has led to a brutal stock market sell-off and pushed mortgage rates sharply higher, dampening the housing market.</p>
    <p class="text-endding">Stocks plunged after the report was released. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 787 points as of 10:15 a.m. and the S&P 500 was down 104 points, putting it just shy of bear market territory, equivalent to a 20% fall since the index hit an all-time high in January. </p>
