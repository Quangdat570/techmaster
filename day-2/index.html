        <p>SMITHSBURG, Md. — At least three people were killed and three others injured including the suspected gunman and a Maryland State Police trooper  in a mass shooting Thursday at a manufacturing facility north of Smithsburg, authorities said.</p>

    <div class="pagagraph-text">
        <p>The Washington County Sheriff's Office said deputies responded to a shooting incident at about 2:30 p.m. When deputies arrived at Columbia Machine, they found four gunshot victims, three of whom were dead.</p>
        <p>The suspect, a male, fled before the sheriff's office arrived, Hose said. A state trooper encountered the suspect and they exchanged gunfire. Both were hit and taken to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Washington County Sheriff Doug Mullendore identified the victims as Mark Alan Frey, 50; Charles Edward Minnick Jr., 31; and Joshua Robert Wallace, 30. All were employees at the facility. The condition of another employee who was injured in the shooting wasn't immediately available.</p>

        <p>The suspect was identified only as a 23-year-old man from West Virginia who also worked at Columbia Machine, which provides concrete products equipment to customers in over 100 countries, according to its website. A motive has not been determined, Mullendore said. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-left">Further details about the suspect, including his name, weren't provided because charges have not yet been filed, Mullendore said. A semi-automatic handgun was used in the shooting, the sheriff said, but he declined to specify the model or caliber.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-transform">"Im devastated by the lives taken today in Smithsburg and for the pain and suffering their loved ones are experiencing," Sen. Chris Van Hollen said in a statement. "Todays horrific shooting comes as our state and nation have witnessed tragedy after tragedy, and it's got to stop. We must act to address the mass shootings and the daily toll of gun violence in our communities."</p>
